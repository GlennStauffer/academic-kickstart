## 1995 - the first club logo

!["1995 Logo"](/img/95logo.gif)

In the summer of 1995, Jason Lisica, one of our early members, designed a club logo which was featured on a run of t-shirts and decals.  The phrase, “Single Cam…Therefore I am.” was coined for this logo and became the unofficial club slogan.

## 1996

In 2007, Geoff Springer, better known as Heffay on the Forums, started work on new SOHC/4 merchandise and re-worked the 2004 10th Anniversary Logo to come up with this new variation on the 1997 logo.  This design has been featured on a variety of club merchandise, mostly sold through our Cafe Press store.
