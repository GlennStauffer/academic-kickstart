The SOHC/4 Owners Club was founded by John Soliday in April 1994.  At the time, the [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) group, rec.motorcycles, enjoyed considerable popularity among motorcycling enthusiasts.  John's post gathered a small group of Honda Four enthusiasts into an informal club.  One of those early members, Glenn Stauffer, had access to a mailing list server and the SOHC/4 mailing list was born.  A short while later, a [website](http://www.sohc4.org) was created as a repository of all of the excellent technical materials being discussed on the list.  After quite a few years, the mailing list moved to an online discussion [forum](http://forums.sohc4.net) which exists as our primary home to this day.

The pages in this section provide a history of the club and document the various club activities that have taken place over the years.
