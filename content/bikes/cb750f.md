# Honda CB750F (1975-1978)

In 1975, Honda revamped the 750 model line, which had evolved to become a reliable, comfortable tourer, with the addition of the CB750F Super Sport.  This model was engineered to take the 750 back to its superbike roots with improved performance, handling, and braking combined with a more radical style highlighted by the four-into-one exhaust.

This model, originally thought to replace the CB750K, remained aside the K model in Honda's lineup through the 1978 model year with few changes.
