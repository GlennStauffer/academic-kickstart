# Honda CB750K - 1969-1978


The CB750 was an historic motorcycle often recognized as the most important motorcycle of the 20th Century. From this revolutionary bike, Honda developed a complete line of reliable four cylinder motorcycles to become the largest motorcycle company in the world and usher in an era of Japanese dominance in the industry.

The CB750 was available in several variations, the CB750K which retained the classic four-into-four pipes and styling of the original 1969 model.  The CB750F which adopted the four-into-one pipes and cafe racer stylings popularized by the CB400F.  And the CB750A, mating the 750 engine to an automatic gearbox.

The CB750 had a production run of 9 years during which a total of, roughly, 553,400 motorcycles were made. The K1 was the most popular single model with sales figures of about 77,000. The second most popular model, the K2, also sold in large numbers, a total of 63,500, due primarily to the fact that this model was in production until 1976 in all markets except the US and Japan.

The first 7,414 bikes produced had sandcast engines.  The identification of these models, which are in great demand amongst collectors, is a bit of a science and is covered in [this]() section of the site.

## Serial Numbers

|   |
|---|
| ![CB750 Serial Numbers](/static/cb750_serial_numbers.png) |
| The frame serial number (fig 1.1) is stamped on the left side of the steering head pipe and the engine serial number (fig 1.2) is located on the top of the crankcase left side.  The serial numbers do not match, but are in the same model series.  It is not uncommon to find CB750's which have a replacement engine from a different model year since engines from all of the CB750K models are compatible with all of the frames. |
