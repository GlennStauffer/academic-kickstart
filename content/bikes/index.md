The SOHC/4 Motorcycles were introduced in 1969.  Over the next 13 years, Honda developed the single overhead cam four cylinder power plant into a line of motorcycles spanning from the revolutionary CB750 to the diminutive CB350F.  Eventually the single overhead cam engine gave way to a double overhead cam design and the SOHC/4 era drew to a close.

The pages in this section provide a model guide for each of the SOHC/4 models.  The guide includes a brief history, production data, an identification guide, and technical data.
