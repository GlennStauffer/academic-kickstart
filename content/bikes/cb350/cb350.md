## History

The small Honda FOUR was initially intended to be two models, a 250cc and 350cc model. In the end, it was judged that the performance of a 250 would be disappointing, due to internal friction losses that were beyond the technology of the time, so only the 350cc four was put into production. The CB350/4 proved a suitable entry level machine for the North American market and Europe.  In spite of its entry-level focus, the CB350 was luxuriously finished with an upright riding position, four tilted-up silencers and chromium-plated mudguards. When first introduced, it attracted attention as the world's first four-cylinder production bike of such small capacity, but this curiosity never translated into market appeal and the CB350 was never a big seller.
