# The CB750A

The CB750A was introduced into the US market in 1976.  This model was aimed at new riders and people who used their motorcycle as a commuter vehicle.  The ease of a two-speed clutch-less transmission mated to a detuned 750cc SOHC/4 engine was envisioned as ideally suited to the burgeoning US motorcycle market.  After somewhat lackluster sales, Honda dropped this model in 1978 in favor of a smaller, 400cc model targeted at this demographic.  Unfortunately, that model also never sold well and the smaller Hondamatic went out of production in 1981.
