## History

Having established four-cylinder credentials with the CB750, Honda undertook the tricky business of making the layout work as effectively in smaller engine sizes. The second type of Honda FOUR, the CB500 was intended as a more elegant sports bike for the mature rider which still retained the essence of the original. 

The compact CB500F four of 1971 immediately impressed with its smoothness, comfort and reliability, proving capable of brisk touring even two-up. It had a smart two-tone colour scheme and a tidy looking power unit with an upright bank of cylinders. With a top speed over 110mph, the reasonably priced 500 filled the bill admirably for many sporting riders of the early 1970s.

A number were raced in the Production TT races on the Isle of Man in the early 1970's. Bill Smith won the 1973 500cc TT Production race (4 laps) riding one, by only 8.2 seconds from second place Stan Woods mounted on a Suzuki T500 two stroke twin.
