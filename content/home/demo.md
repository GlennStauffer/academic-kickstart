Welcome to the **SOHC/4 Owners Club Website**!

In 1969, Honda started a motorcycle revolution with the introduction of the CB750, the world's first superbike.  Over the next decade, this single model evolved into a popular line of horizonal four cylinder motorcycles with something for every rider and riding style - from the diminutive CB350F to the three CB750 models.

The SOHC/4 website and forums was founded in 1994 by a small group of Honda single overhead cam four enthusiats.  From our early beginnings as an email list, the group grew into an active online [discussion forum](http://forums.sohc4.net) where a wealth of information has been freely shared amongst members.

This site was created as a repository of all of this information.  The information available in these pages includes a model guide for each motorcycle model as well as general information about the club and the resources such as manuals and articles available to forum members.
