# Support the SOHC/4 Owners Club

The SOHC/4 Owners Club has proudly offered a wealth of free resources to Honda single overhead cam four enthusiasts since 1994.  Over the years, we've managed to cover the cost to put all this online through advertisements, but that revenue stream has slowed to a trickle as a result of ad blockers and declining payments from the ad engines.

Our goal for the future is to become solely member supported.  To do this, we need members to contribute to the site both financially and by volunteering services.

Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

- Make a [ONE-TIME contribution](http://paypal.me/GlennStauffer) of any amount.  Contributions of $50 US or more earn you a place on this month's contributor's board.
- [Cover my hosing costs](http://paypal.me/GlennStauffer/150).  A one-time contribution of $150 covers the hosting costs of the SOHC/4 sites for the month.
- A monthly subscription is a great way to show your continued support for the site.  Subscription plans include:
  - [A buck a month](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-6J943599GF248251XL3OL7YI)
  - [Buy me a coffee](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/billing/plans/subscribe?plan_id=P-4P724455ED780053YL3OL52A)
